# English to Hinglish Translation

GitHub repository:-

# Description
    This project demonstrates English to Hinglish translation using various translation models, including IBM Model 1 and the Transformers library's MarianMTModel,Pipeline.

## How to Run the Model

### Prerequisites

Before running the model, make sure you have the following installed:

- Libraries: nltk, translate, transformers

You can install the required libraries using pip.

# Running the Model
    i)Open the Code in a Python IDE:
        Open your preferred Python Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or code editor.
    
    ii)Run the Whole Code:
        Open the Python script containing your code in the IDE.
        Execute the entire code by running it.

    iii)Provide User Input:
        When the program runs, it will prompt you to enter an English sentence.
        Input your English sentence as requested.

    iv)Translation Output:
        The program will utilize different translation models to provide translations of your input sentence into Hinglish.
        The translated output will be displayed in the console.
        You will see translations from various models, including IBM Model 1, Transformers Pipeline Model, and MarianMTModel.
        Review the translations provided by each model.

    v)Experiment with Different Inputs:
        You can experiment with different English sentences by running the code again and providing new input.

This process allows you to interactively translate English sentences into Hinglish using various translation models. Enjoy exploring the capabilities of the models and their translation quality!


 

1)Install the required libraries:

    pip install nltk, translate, transformers.

2)Sample Output
  
  # Using IBM Model 1 :

Input:
    "Please don't forget to bring the $100 bill, it's crucial!"

Output:
    Translated Output (Hinglish) using IBMModel1 translate: कृपया 100 बिल को महत्वपूर्ण बनाना न भूलें

   # Using Transformers MarianMTModel :

Input:
    Please don't forget to bring the $100 bill, it's crucial!

output:
    Translated Output (Hindi) using Transformers: "कृपया 100 बिल लाने के लिए मत भूलना, यह महत्वपूर्ण है!"

   # Using MarianMTModel :

Input:
    Please don't forget to bring the $100 bill, it's crucial!

output:
    Translated Output (Hindi) using MarianMTModel Transformers: "कृपया 100 बिल लाने के लिए मत भूलना, यह महत्वपूर्ण है!"
